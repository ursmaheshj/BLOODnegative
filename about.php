			  <b><i><u>Why are we here ?</u></i></b><br><br>
			  Many times we have witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor
		      was not available at the <br>most needed hour. Is there something that we as a responsible
 			  citizen can do to prevent this.<br><br>
			  "BLOOD negative" is an public organisation that brings voluntary blood donors and 
			  those in <br>need of blood on to a common platform. Through this website, we seek donors
			  who are willing <br>to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest support to those in 
			  frantic need of it.<br><br>
			  Our mission is to fulfill every blood request in india by providing a promising web-platform
			  and motivating <br> individuals who are willing to donate blood.<br><br>
			  Our vision is to be HOPE of each and every citizen of india when they need BLOOD.<br><br>

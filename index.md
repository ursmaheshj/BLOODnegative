## BLOODnegative

Many times we have witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour. Is there something that we as a responsible citizen can do to prevent this.

"BLOOD negative" is an public organisation that brings voluntary blood donors and those in need of blood on to a common platform. Through this website, we seek donors who are willing to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest support to those in frantic need of it.

Our mission is to fulfill every blood request in india by providing a promising web-platform and motivating individuals who are willing to donate blood.

## BLOODnegative

This was my first college project where i build a fully functional website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript at frontend and backend with PHP.

### About the Platform

- **Home Page**: When you first visit a website, it displays an elegant home page, like the one below, with information on upcoming donation camps and links to register as donors or search for donors.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ursmaheshj/BLOODnegative/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

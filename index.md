### About the Platform

- **Home Page**: When you first visit a website, it displays an elegant home page, like the one below, with information on upcoming donation camps and links to register as donors or search for donors.

- **About Us**: This contains a summary of the significance of the _Blood Negative_ platform in modern society and how it might benefit patients.

- **Search form**: By entering your blood group and area code, you can find the needed donor.

### How it works

The actual working of the platform solely depends on the two entities _PIN Code_ and _Blood group_. We ask users to supply this information when they sign up to be blood donors; afterwards, when a patient searches for the Donor, they must also provide the same information. We then apply a filter to the data based on these parameters to show the corresponding blood donors.
    
### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ursmaheshj/BLOODnegative/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
